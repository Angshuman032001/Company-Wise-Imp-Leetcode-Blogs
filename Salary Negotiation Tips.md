Hi Everyone,

Many of you would be searching for this answer like me and searching for tips on LC/Blind/Other forums. Let me give you some tips based on my experience. I posted this post on compensation because I feel this is the most viewed section amongst all other discussion sections in LC.

Current TC: 61 LPA
Offered TC: 1.1 CR for first year, 1.01 CR from 2nd year onwards
YOE: 8 years

Tip 1: Never disclose your exprected TC. I SAY NEVER.
Tip 2: If you are holding another offer disclose that at right time. Never disclose your another offer beforehand. Let the company comes first with their package then disclose the offer you are holding and ask for more TC bump.

If you disclose the offer before the company gives number its your loss only in either way.

Option 1: It may happen that they will back out as you are holding already an offer and in future if you get any new offer then there is possibility you will also not join their company.

Option 2: In another option suppose they had budget of 75 lacs but you asked TC in range of 65-75 LPA and they would happily offer you 65 LPA and you have left 10 LPA on the table. Once you give the range HR always listens to the lower number of the range(65 LPA in above example).

so in either way its your loss only.

You can negotiate in any of the below component.

Base Salary
Stock options
Joining bonus
Relocation bonus

Last imp thing make sure you are polite to HR
